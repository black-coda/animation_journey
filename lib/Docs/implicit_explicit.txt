Implicit Animations
If your animation does only one thing thatâ€™s it animates from one value to another and
is a single widget then you should go with implicit animations.
Implicit animations offer the easiest
and fastest way to get started with animations in Flutter.


Animations can also interpolate types other than double, such as Animation<Color> or Animation<Size>.

An Animation object has state. Its current value is always available in the .value member.

An Animation object knows nothing about rendering or build() functions.
